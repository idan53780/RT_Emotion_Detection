# 🎭 Real Time Emotion Detection

A real-time emotion recognition application using a webcam or video file input. This project is built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model.
<br>
## 📚Project Description

This project develops a system for real-time emotion detection from video. 

The system uses OpenCV for facial detection and a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the emotions displayed on faces.

The goal is to create a tool that can assist in applications such as:

* User experience analysis
* Communication aids for individuals with communication impairments
* Audience reaction analysis


> 🚧 **This project is under active development.** Features and performance will improve in future versions.
<br>

## 📌 Features

- Detects human emotions (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry) in real-time.
- Works with webcam or video file input.
- Uses pre-trained deep learning models.
- GUI with:
  - Start menu
  - Source switch (webcam/video file)
  - Screenshot capture functionality
<br>

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **TensorFlow**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Keras (with pre-trained model)**
